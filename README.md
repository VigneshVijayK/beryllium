# Beryllium Android Development

A custom Android development project for the **Xiaomi POCO F1 (Beryllium)** and other Snapdragon 845 (SDM845) devices.

## About

Xiaomi officially ended support for newer Android versions on the POCO F1 after Android 10 / MIUI 10. In response, I have ported MIUI builds—both official and community (e.g., from Xiaomi.eu)—to the Snapdragon 845 platform.

These builds have been successfully booted on the POCO F1 and other SDM845-based devices. They are provided **completely free** for the community.

## Features

- Ported MIUI builds (official/unofficial)
- Support for multiple Snapdragon 845 devices
- Stable boots and public releases
- Community-driven updates
